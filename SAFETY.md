# SAFETY.md — Plasma Dream-Web Safety Protocol

**Version:** 2.2
**Date:** 19 April 2026 
**Compliance:** Health Canada RIAQG, CSA C22.1:24

## ⚠️ GENERAL WARNINGS

This project involves **high-voltage electrical discharges** (3–15 kV AC), **ultraviolet radiation**, and **reactive oxygen species (ROS)**. Improper construction or operation can cause **electrical shock, burns, eye damage, or respiratory harm**.

**Do not build or operate any prototype without:**
1. Reading this entire document
2. Understanding basic high-voltage safety
3. Having appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. Verifying ozone levels with a calibrated sensor

## 1. Electrical Safety (CSA C22.1:24 Compliance)

### 1.1 Power Envelope
- All prototypes operate at **<50 W input power**
- Input voltage: 12–24 VDC from commercial power supply
- Output: 3–15 kV AC at 20–50 kHz (ZVS resonant)

### 1.2 Mandatory Precautions
- **Enclosure:** All high-voltage components must be enclosed in insulating housing
- **Grounding:** Chassis ground connected to power supply ground
- **Isolation:** High-voltage output isolated from low-voltage control (Arduino)
- **Silicone sealing:** All electrode edges sealed with high-voltage silicone
- **Fusing:** 5A fuse on 12V input; thermal fuse on flyback transformer
- **Labeling:** "DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE" labels on all enclosures (bilingual English/French for NB compliance)

### 1.3 Capacitor Discharge
- ZVS tank capacitor (0.68 µF at up to 400V) stores lethal energy
- **Always discharge capacitors** with a 10 kΩ bleeder resistor before servicing
- Wait minimum 5 minutes after power-off before touching any component

## 2. Ozone Exposure (Health Canada RIAQG)

### 2.1 Regulatory Limit
- **Maximum residential exposure:** 20 ppb (40 µg/m³) averaged over 8 hours
- Source: Health Canada Residential Indoor Air Quality Guideline for Ozone

### 2.2 Monitoring Protocol
- **MQ-131 ozone sensor** connected to Arduino Nano
- Continuous monitoring during all atmospheric-pressure DBD operation
- **Auto-shutoff threshold:** 15 ppb (75% of limit, providing safety margin)
- **Audible alarm threshold:** 10 ppb (early warning)

### 2.3 Ventilation Requirements
- Minimum room ventilation: 2 air changes per hour (ACH)
- Recommended: operate near open window or with exhaust fan
- **Never operate in sealed/unventilated space**

### 2.4 Argon Low-Pressure DBD
- At <10 Torr argon pressure: ozone production is **near zero**
- No Health Canada ozone compliance issue for sealed argon systems
- Verify seal integrity before each operation

---

## 3. Ultraviolet Radiation

### 3.1 Atmospheric DBD
- UV-C emission (200–280 nm) at low intensity
- Standard borosilicate glass absorbs >99% of UV below 300 nm
- **No direct viewing** of bare discharge without glass barrier

### 3.2 Argon Excimer (172 nm VUV)
- VUV radiation absorbed by air within **millimeters**
- No exposure risk at >5 cm in atmosphere
- **MgF₂ or LiF windows** required if VUV transmission is desired (e.g., sterilization applications)
- **Never look directly** at VUV source through transmitting optics
- UV-rated safety glasses required when working with VUV-transmitting windows

---

## 4. MHD / Magnetic Field Safety

### 4.1 Permanent Magnets
- N52 neodymium magnets are **extremely strong** — pinch hazard
- Keep magnets away from electronic devices, credit cards, pacemakers
- **Pacemaker/medical implant exclusion zone: 30 cm minimum**

### 4.2 Electromagnet Coils
- Coils may reach 60–80 °C under sustained operation
- **Thermal shutdown at 85 °C** (thermistor + Arduino control)
- Burn hazard — do not touch coils during or immediately after operation

### 4.3 Mechanical Failure
- If feedback control fails, levitated orb will fall
- **Soft landing pad** (foam or silicone mat) required beneath orb
- Borosilicate sphere may shatter on hard impact — eye protection required

---

## 5. Gas Safety (Argon Systems)

### 5.1 Argon Properties
- Inert, non-toxic, non-flammable
- Heavier than air (density 1.784 kg/m³ vs air 1.225 kg/m³)
- **Asphyxiation risk** in enclosed spaces with large volumes (>100 L release)

### 5.2 Vacuum Vessel
- Borosilicate vessels rated for <1 Torr adequate for small volumes (<1 L)
- **Implosion risk** — do not use cracked or chipped glass
- Safety shield (polycarbonate) recommended around vacuum vessels >500 mL
- Pressure relief valve required on vessels >1 L

## 6. Prototype-Specific Warnings

| Prototype | Additional Hazard | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 (MHD Orb) | Falling sphere, strong magnets | Landing pad, magnet handling gloves |
| 2 (Greenhouse) | Plant proximity to HV, ozone on plants | Sealed electrode panel, sensor |
| 3 (Zero-G) | Vacuum vessel, argon release | Safety shield, ventilation |
| 4 (Underwater) | Water + electricity | IP68 rating mandatory, GFCI on all circuits |
| 5 (Wall) | Large panel, audio coupling | Secure mounting, hearing protection at >85 dB |
| 6 (Canopy) | Sleep proximity, prolonged ozone | Ultra-low ozone threshold (5 ppb), timer limit 8 hr |
| 7 (Urban) | Scale, public exposure | Professional electrical installation, municipal permits |

## 7. Emergency Procedures

### Electrical Shock
1. **Do not touch the person** if they are still in contact with the circuit
2. Disconnect power at the source (unplug or switch off breaker)
3. Call 911 / administer CPR if trained
4. All ZVS systems have <50 W capacity but flyback output is potentially lethal

### Ozone Overexposure
1. Move to fresh air immediately
2. Symptoms: coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath
3. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist
4. Auto-shutoff should prevent overexposure — verify sensor function before each session

### Glass Breakage
1. Do not handle broken borosilicate with bare hands
2. Sweep, do not vacuum (fine glass particles)
3. If argon vessel breaks: ventilate room, no immediate toxicity concern

## 8. PPE Requirements

| Activity | Required PPE |
|----------|-------------|
| ZVS assembly/testing | Insulating gloves (Class 0), safety glasses |
| Atmospheric DBD operation | Ozone monitor, ventilation |
| Argon/vacuum work | Safety glasses, hearing protection |
| MHD magnet handling | Magnet-rated gloves, eye protection |
| VUV optics work | UV-rated safety glasses |
